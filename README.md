# csharp-UDPBroadcast

This project's aim is to provide a simple interface to broadcast messages within the local network over [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol). Just in case you can't do any [Zeroconf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking), [UPnP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play), [PGM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatic_General_Multicast), or message queuing with publish semantics to register and publish services with zero to none configuration effort.
